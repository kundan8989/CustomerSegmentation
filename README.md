# CustomerSegmentation

## The objective of this project is to predict customer categories using demographic and transaction data. 
It involves building a complete machine learning pipeline—from data preprocessing to deployment—using Random Forest for classification. This data science project aims to develop a system that can accurately predict customer personalities based on their personal and purchasing information. The solution will be highly beneficial for malls, retail stores, and other product-based businesses. By analyzing customer demographics and purchase history, we can cluster customers and then use classification algorithms to predict the cluster to which a new customer belongs.


## What is the problem?
Businesses like malls or stores want to understand what type of customers visit them. If they know this, they can:

1.Recommend the right products
2.Send targeted advertisements
3.Improve customer service

But they don’t want to manually analyze every customer.
So, we need to build a machine learning system that:
Looks at a customer’s demographic data (e.g., age, gender, income)
Looks at shopping data (e.g., how much and how often they spend)
Predicts what kind of customer group (or category) they belong to

# for example
You want to categorize these customers as:

Budget Shoppers,
Luxury Shoppers,
Occasional Shoppers,
Loyal Customers

Once categorized, the next time a new customer walks in, the system should predict their category using their details.
